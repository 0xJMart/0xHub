# `@0xhub/ui`

Shared UI primitives and design system components for the Hub frontend and micro-frontends.

- `src/` holds source TypeScript/React components and styling tokens.
- Build tooling will be added in later phases to publish compiled artifacts.

> Phase 0 placeholder: add component scaffolds and build pipeline alongside design tokens during Phase 2.
